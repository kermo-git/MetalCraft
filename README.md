# MetalCraft

This is my hobby project to create a MineCraft-like game for Apple devices. The following devices are supported:
* **macOS** devices (MacBook and iMac). These must have Apple silicon (e.g M1, M2 or M3), not Intel processors.
* **iOS** devices (iPhone and iPad)

The name comes from the fact that it uses [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) API to render 3D graphics. User interface is created using [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/).

## Setup instructions

You need a macOS computer.

1) Clone the repo.
2) Download [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) if you don't have it yet. You can get it from their website or App Store.
3) Open `MetalCraft.xcodeproj` in XCode.
4) After the project is opened in XCode, look for target option on top of the screen, it should read *MetalCraft (macOS)* or *MetalCraft (iOS)*. Use this to select which version of the game you want to run.
6) For iOS version, you don't need a real device, XCode can run the game in a simulator. Next to target option you should see another option for device type, e.g *MetalCraft (iOS) > iPhone 15*.
7) To run the game on an actual iOS device, connect it to your computer using a cable. Then you should see it in the list of devices. If you don't see it, restarting XCode or computer will help.
8) Click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button or press Cmd+R to run the game.
9) Play around with the code and run again üòä.

Until I improve the GUI and add an intruction manual.
